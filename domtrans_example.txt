# This is needed for when you create a custom policy using sepolgen, but the process spawns under the context of the parent process,

# In this case, you must explicitly specify the following code in the .te file generated by sepolgen before you compile it!

# The type that goes in the gen_require and first argument of domtrans_pattern is the type of the parent process.
# The 2nd argument to domtrans_pattern is the selinux type of the binary you want to confine on disk.
# The 3rd agurment is the custom type you want the process to run as
